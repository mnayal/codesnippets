    "Let's see how many moves are required for stacks of different heights.
    A one disk stack is trivial - :A to :C (assuming :A is starting pin,
    :C is the destination and :B is the one in the middle).
    For a 2 disk stack - put the top disk out of the way by moving it to :B,
    then move the bottom disk to :C and finally move the smaller disk from :B to :C.
    A stack of 3 presents intersting challenges but let's see if we can restate our problem
    in a way that makes it easier to solve.
    Can we move the top 2 disks from :A to :B using :C only as an intermediate holding pin ?
    Yes we already know how to do that.
    After moving the 2 top disks onto :B, move the bottom disk to :C.
    As a last step move the 2 disks from :B to :C using :A as intermediate storage.

    So it seems we have a method here:
    For n disks:
    Move n - 1 disks to pin :B.
    Move 1 disk to :C.
    Move n - 1 disks from :B to :C.
    In mathematics this goes by the fancy name of induction.

    Args - n is the number of disks in tower.
           from-pin is the starting pin on which all the n disks are placed initially.
           to-pin is the destination pin on which all the n disks should rest at the end.
           using-pin is the intermediate resting place for any pins while we are moving them from from-pin to to-pin.
    Return - a sequence of moves. Each move is a hash-map with two keys - :from and :to - which are the source and
             destination pin for a move.
    Note: The rules state that no smaller disk should ever be placed under a larger disk."
